This is the supplementary material for our submission to the IEEE Control Systems Letters. It includes the data used in our study as well as the optimization and solving code.

To run the code, please make sure that you have YALMIP installed on your computer, as well as solvers such as MOSEK, CPLEX, or Gurobi.

The explanation of the file contents is as follows:

（1）Run "MIP.m" to solve the MIPs (11) in our paper.

（2）"exp1_data.mat" and "exp2_data.mat" are partial noisy data used in Example 1 and 2, respectively.
