This is the supplementary material for our submission to the IEEE Control Systems Letters. It includes the data used in our study as well as the code for solving the optimazation problem and calculate control gain.

To run the code, please make sure that you have YALMIP installed on your computer, as well as solvers such as MOSEK, CPLEX, or Gurobi.

The explanation of the file contents is as follows:

（1）"exp1_data.mat", "exp2_pdata.mat", and "exp2_cdata.mat" are data used in Example 1, partial noisy data used in Example 2, and complete noisy data used in Example 2, respectively.

（2）"Example1.m",  "Example2_partial.m", and  "Example2_complete.m" are code for Example 1 and Example with differect data.
