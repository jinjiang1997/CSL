This is the supplementary material for our submission to the IEEE Control Systems Letters. It includes the data used in our study as well as the code for solving the optimazation problem and calculate control gain.

To run the code, please make sure that you have YALMIP installed on your computer, as well as solvers such as MOSEK, CPLEX, or Gurobi.

The explanation of the file contents is as follows:

（1）"exp1_data.mat", "exp2_pdata.mat", and "exp2_cdata.mat" are data used in Example 1, partial noisy data used in Example 2, and complete noisy data used in Example 2, respectively.

（2）"Example1.m" is the code for Example 1.   "Example2_partial.m" and  "Example2_complete.m" are code for Example 2 using partial noisy data and  complete noisy data, respectively.

 (3) "exp2_data.mat" is the partial noisy data generated by the system in example 2. Run "length_change.m" shows the how the calculated upper bounds change with the increase of sample length. It illustrates the increase of sample length would not lead to a conservative bound.
